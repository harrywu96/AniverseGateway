# Cursor Agent Terminal Configuration

## PowerShell Environment Setup

When working with this project in a PowerShell terminal, always execute the following commands in order:

```powershell
# 1. Set execution policy to allow script execution in the current process
Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope Process

# 2. Activate the virtual environment
.\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1

# 3. Synchronize dependencies using UV
uv pip sync requirements.txt
```

## Important Notes

- Always run these commands in the specified order
- The execution policy change is scoped to the current process only
- The virtual environment must be activated before using any Python commands
- Dependencies should always be synchronized using `uv pip sync` not with regular pip
- This ensures consistent behavior across development environments

## Commands Explanation

1. **Set-ExecutionPolicy**: Allows PowerShell to run scripts in the current session
2. **Activate.ps1**: Activates the Python virtual environment created with UV
3. **uv pip sync**: Ensures all dependencies match exactly what's in requirements.txt

Do not modify these terminal instructions without updating the corresponding project setup.
