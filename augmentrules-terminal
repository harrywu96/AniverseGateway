terminal: PowerShell Terminal Configuration

When executing PowerShell terminal commands in this project, always follow these exact steps in order:

1. First set the execution policy to allow scripts to run:
   Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope Process

2. Then activate the Python virtual environment:
   .venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1

3. When managing dependencies, always use UV instead of pip:
   - To sync dependencies: uv pip sync requirements.txt
   - To add a new dependency: uv pip install [package]
   - To compile requirements: uv pip compile requirements.in -o requirements.txt

IMPORTANT:
- Never use regular pip commands (always use uv pip)
- Always activate the virtual environment before running Python commands
- The execution policy must be set in each new PowerShell session
- You can run the setup-env.ps1 script to automate these steps

If you need to run a terminal command, first check if the virtual environment is activated (the prompt should show (.venv)). If not, execute these steps first.
