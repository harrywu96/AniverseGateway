terminal: gitBash Terminal Configuration

When executing gitBash terminal commands in this project, always follow these exact steps in order:

1. When managing dependencies, always use UV instead of pip:
   - To sync dependencies: uv pip sync requirements.txt
   - To add a new dependency: uv pip install [package]
   - To compile requirements: uv pip compile requirements.in -o requirements.txt

IMPORTANT:
- Never use regular pip commands (always use uv pip)
- Always activate the virtual environment before running Python commands

If you need to run a terminal command, first check if the virtual environment is activated (the prompt should show (ai_project)). If not, execute these steps first.

1. locate where you are and enter the project directory
2. Activate the virtual environment: source .venv/bin/activate
